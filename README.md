## ETL Functions for Three Data Files:
 
 Britta was assigned to create an extract tranform and load with tables and loading data into existing tables daily by Amazing Prime a daily database. The purpose for her assignment was to create fuctions with Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and Movielens rating data and determine performs forthe  three files using Python, ETL(extract,transform and load), process and PostgreSQL database to create the daily tables. 

 In the first deleverable Britta was to use Kaggle Metadata and MovieLens to determine the rating of the Movies. She was able to use the wikipedial json with the raw Wikipedia movie file to extract, tranform and load the data into a new file. The file was to create tables. Then wer were to check the ratings of the movies by ide and timestamp. 

The next part of Britta project was deliveable 2, where she extract tranform the wikipedia data using python, pandas, and the ETL process to merge  with Wikipedia raw data and Kaggle metadata IMDb IDs. Britta has a number of steps to complete after extracting the data, now she has to create a function to clean the movie data to catch errors and to review if there are null values in the dataframe of the box office column. She was able to include a lambda function as well as other expressions to match the six elements of the box office data. The wiki.data file was based off the url and tear from the uimbdb_link cinimography and date in which it was released. So in review Britta was able to clean the data with the realse date and running time. She was able to clean the Kaggle data and merge the wikipedaia dn kaggle dataframe together. In addition she was able to tranform and merge the rating data sets into the table, movies with ratings.df.
  
  The third part of the process was Deleverable 3, where she was required to extract the data, transform the Kaggle dataframe to create a new dataframe movies_df. She was able to arange various columns and filter then rename parts of the data. Britta then was able to extract, tranformation, clean and counts the MovieLens rating data using the ETL function. If the data was not there she was placing a "0" in the emplty space. 
  
  Lastly she was creating a movie database in PostgreSQL to query the movies and ratings data tables to determine the rating_query.
